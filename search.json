    "text": "1.2 What is data?\nThe Merriam-Webster online dictionary provides three definitions of the word data:\n\nfactual information (such as measurements or statistics) used as a basis for reasoning, discussion, or calculation.\n\n\ninformation in digital form that can be transmitted or processed\n\n\ninformation output by a sensing device or organ that includes both useful and irrelevant or redundant information and must be processed to be meaningful\n\n— Merriam-Webster dictionary\n\n\nTogether, these definitions offer us a set of key elements from which we can build a broad understanding of the concept of data. The first key term is factual information or fact suggesting that data is objective and, like the rest of the definition shows, is used for a given purpose, such as discussing reasoning or decision-making.\nThe second definition is related to using the word data in a computational or communicational sense, where data is the “thing” that is being stored, transmitted, received, processed, etc.\nWhile the first definition suggests that humans and machines use data for processes such as decisions and calculations, the third definition highlights that data does not only exist in nature but can also be created by humans and machines, either purposefully or not.\nWhile we often think of data as things found in spreadsheets and stored in computers or filing cabinets, data is much more than that. Data is everywhere around us all the time in the form of energy and sound or light waves, for instance. Our sensory organs are data captors that pick up data from our environment. Our brains process, structure, and possibly store the data so we can consciously or unconsciously use it now or later as a basis for decisions and actions. That said, in this course, we will not concern ourselves with this kind of data and process. Instead, we will focus on digitally recorded data, the kind that we can store in a computer."

The terms data and dataset will often be used interchangeably since dataset literally means a set of data, and data is the plural of datum. One difference, in principle, is that datasets are usually assembled for a given purpose. In research, for instance, a dataset will be the exact collection of data collected for the analysis. In supervised machine learning, we distinguish between training and testing datasets. When a professor sends you an excel file with data to work with for an assignment, that’s a dataset. You find datasets when you browse websites like kaggle.com, zenodo.org, or dataverse.org. Datasets are also static, whereas databases can be dynamic."

    "text": "1.4 Databases\nWhat is a database? According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, a database is “a usually large collection of data organized especially for rapid search and retrieval (as by a computer)”. The keyword here is organized, highlighting that databases are both products and tools for data management.\nDatabases are usually created and managed for some purposes. These purposes may be specific (e.g. keeping track of a store’s inventory) or broad (tracking socioeconomic trends). Depending on their purposes, databases can vary in size and complexity. Any organized data collection could be considered a database, even if it is as basic as an Excel spreadsheet with the names and addresses of your friends or your to-do list.\nA database can contain or be used to create multiple datasets, but a dataset would typically not contain multiple databases. Of course, this does not mean that datasets are always drawn from databases. For example, datasets can be created by surveying or interviewing people or recording observations of natural phenomena.\nNote, however, that those differences are not hard truths, as some datasets may serve a greater variety of users and purposes than some databases."

    "text": "1.5 Database management systems (DBMS)\nA Database Management System (DBMS) is software that supports the development, maintenance, security, and use of databases. You will often come across the DBMS acronym with different suffixes attached to it, such as RDBMS (Relational DBMS), OODBMS (Object-Oriented DBMS), or ORDBMS (Object-Relational DBMS). Note that all these DBMS generally offer the same basic features. The main difference is that they work with different data types and structures. In this course you will use one RDBMS called pgAdmin to put implement your database design on a live server. You will also be introduced to the two popular DBMSs: MongoDB and Neo4j for document databases and graph databases, respectively.\nMost DBMS are pretty easy to get started with, and some will provide standard templates for tables and data structures. But as Hernandez (2013) writes in the introduction of their popular database design book, diving in without proper preparation and relying too much on templates is an easy way to end up with a design that is inefficient or does not work. A bad database design will lead to data problems such as missing, incorrect, or mismatched data. It will fail to play its role in supporting the organization or serving the users."

Data managers unlock the potential of data for a given purpose, individual, group or organization, by developing and implementing data strategies and processes such as data retrieval, processing, cleaning, storage and analysis.\nThe value of data depends on the purpose it serves. Thus, good data management requires a good understanding of both the data and the needs of its users so that optimal data strategies can be developed and implemented. In this course, you will get familiar with several tools to manage data and data-related processes and design a database that addresses the needs of an organization or group."

    "section": "1.7 From unstructured to structured data",
    "text": "1.7 From unstructured to structured data\nData can take many forms that we can situate along a continuum with unstructured data at one extreme, structured data at the other, and semi-structured data in between. Let us consider a simple example to better grasp the difference between structured and unstructured data and, at the same time, to get a sense of the process of structuring data so that it can be more effectively strored and analyzed.\nHere is a brilliant piece of writing:\n\nA data story\nPhilippe Mongeon\nChapter 1\nOnce upon a time, a random internet user created a short text and abandoned it in a sea of unstructured data.\nChapter 2\nAn algorithm passed by and decided to add XML tags to the text.\nChapter 3\nA data manager stumbled upon the data and thought it would be relevant for the database users. So they decided to add it to their relational database.\nThe end.\n\nThat’s unstructured data (not entirely, the line breaks are a very basic structure). We humans who have read a book before can see the structure, but for a computer, this is just text. So now, let us give this text a little bit more structure by applying XML tags.\n\n&lt;book&gt;\n&lt;title&gt;A data story&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;author&gt;Philippe Mongeon&lt;/author&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time a short text was created by a random internet user and abandoned in a sea of unstructured data.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An algorithm passed by and decided to add xml tags to the text.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A data manager stumbled upon the data, thought it would be relevant for the database users, and so she decided to add it to include it in her relational database.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The end.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/book&gt;\n\nThe XML tags already help us (and the computer) identify different text components, such as the title, the author, headers and paragraphs. XML documents are a typical example of semi-structured data.\nAnother frequently used semi-structured format is JSON, which in this case would look like this:\n\n{\n  \"title\": \"A data story\",\n  \"author\": \"Philippe Mongeon\",\n  \"Chapter 1\": \"Once upon a time a short text was created by a random internet user and abandoned in a sea of unstructured data.\",\n  \"Chapter 2\": \"An algorithm passed by and decided to add xml tags to the text.\",\n  \"Chapter 3\": \"A data manager stumbled upon the data, thought it would be relevant for the database users, and so she decided to add it to her relational database. The end.\"\n}\n\nNotice how I included the Chapter number in the tags here in this example? That was an arbitrary choice, and I could have chosen another structure for my file, such as this one:\n\n{\n  \"title\": \"A data story\",\n  \"author\": \"Philippe Mongeon\",\n  \"Chapters\": [\n      {\n        \"title\": \"Chapter 1\",\n        \"content\": \"Once upon a time a short text was created by a random internet user and abandoned in a sea of unstructured data.\"\n      }\n      {\n        \"title\": \"Chapter 2\",\n        \"content\": \"An algorithm passed by and decided to add xml tags to the text.\"\n      }\n      {\n        \"title\": \"Chapter 3\",\n        \"content\": \"A data manager stumbled upon the data, thought it would be relevant for the database users, and so she decided to add it to her relational database. The end.\"\n      }\n  ]\n}\n\nThis structure (or semi-structure) is just as good as the previous one. That flexibility is one of the reasons why semi-structured data formats and databases are growing in popularity. Because the data structure is included directly in the document, the users do not need to follow a predefined structure and use predefined tags to store their data in the database. This means that, theoretically, every record could have a different structure, which would be fine, but most likely not optimal. We will explore this type of structure and a popular DBMSs that uses it (MongoDB) later in the course.\nStructured data and databases are typically tabular (like an Excel spreadsheet). Each row is a record or entry, and each column is a field, feature, variable, etc. The structure is part of the database design (and not each database entry, as in the semi-structured format), and so every new record has to follow that same format. For example, here is the same work of art in a structured format.\n\n\n\nExample of structured data\n\n\nTitle\nAuthor\nSection\nContent\n\n\n\n\nA data story\nPhilippe Mongeon\nChapter 1\nOnce upon a time a data was created by a random internet user and abandoned in a see of unstructured data.\n\n\nA data story\nPhilippe Mongeon\nChapter 2\nAn algorithm passed by and decided to add xml tags to the text.\n\n\nA data story\nPhilippe Mongeon\nChapter 3\nA data manager stumbled upon the data, thought it would be relevant for the database users, and so she decided to add it to include it in her relational database. The end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, the structure is determined by the columns I chose for my table (title, author, section, and content). But, again, this was an arbitrary choice, and I could have chosen a completely different structure (although the realm of possibilities is somewhat limited by the data and by common sense). The point is that there is rarely an absolute best way of structuring data, and the best structure is the one that best suits the needs of the users. Sometimes the same data may be duplicated and structured differently to suit different users and uses.\nPerhaps you noticed that the title and author information is repeated in this last example, which is not a great database design. This course will teach you how to avoid such redundancies and design sound and efficient relational databases. We will talk about the relational model later in the course, but for now, note that relational databases are types of databases that follow a set of rules and principles that make them best suited for structured data."

    "text": "2.2 What is a relational database?\nRelational databases store relations that are represented as tables. Each column of a table is an attribute (also called field, variable or feature), and tuples (or records) are a set of attributes. For example, consider the table below, which is a set of relations representing students. Each record is a unique student defined by four attributes: their student ID, first name, last name, and program. The subject represented in this table are the students, and the same set of limited features represents all the students. No student can exist in this database with different features than the others. A relational database is a collection of tables linked to one another, each representing a different subject (courses, buildings, animals, concerts, orders, conversations, families, foods, games, or anything that we wish to capture in the database), and each with their own set of fields, and records.\n\nThe figure below shows how tables are linked to one another in the relational model.\n\nIn the next few weeks, you will learn how to design your own relational database, so let’s get started."

    "title": "2  Relational databases (Pt. 1)",
    "section": "2.3 Mission and objectives",
    "text": "2.3 Mission and objectives\nAs I mentioned in the opening chapter of this book, databases are created for a specific purpose, and that purpose should be clearly defined before you start creating tables and fields and their relationships. This is the first step of the database design process that Hernandez (2013) proposes in his book, so let us start there are well.\n\n2.3.1 Database mission statement\nThe database mission statement is a short text written in general and accessible language that states the specific purpose of your database. It is important to note that it is not the same as the organization’s mission statement for which the database will be designed. Instead, this statement refers specifically to the database and what the database will do for the organization. To keep that in mind as you formulate your database mission statement, you may want to start the text the following way:\n\nThe purpose of the name of organization and/or organizational unit database is…\n\nThis way you are less likely to forget that the database is what matters here.\nIdeally, your database mission statement would be aligned with the organization’s mission for which it is intended, so having a good understanding of the organization’s mission is essential. In real life, this part of the database design process would likely involve conducting interviews with the key actors of the organization and across its different departments to ensure that you have a good idea of the needs that your database will be addressing. However, in the context of this course, you will not be conducting interviews. You will have to use your best judgment to ensure that your database mission statement is related to the organization’s mission. Also, since organizations usually state their missions on their website, you can certainly use that information to help you.\nIt should also be noted that the database that you will be proposing and its mission statement do not necessarily have to cover everything that an organization does. You could, for instance, choose to develop a database that would support the teaching mission of a university without considering or mentioning the other missions of the university, such as research.\nOther constraints present in the context of the course, but not in real life, are the minimum number of specific tasks that your database should be supporting (5) and the minimum number of required tables in your database design (10). You can use these requirements to gauge whether your mission statement is too narrow or too broad.\n\n2.3.1.1 A database for GummyBox\nGummyBox is a new online store specializing in the sale and delivery of gummies and gummy assortments. The organization needs a database to support its operations. The company has multiple divisions with their own data needs. The HR department deals with employee records and data on pay and benefits, the purchasing department deals with orders to the suppliers, and the sales team handles customers’ orders. We decided to design a database that will support the operations of the sales department, and so we decided to name the database gummybox_sales and formulate its mission as follows:\n\nThe purpose of the gummybox_sales database is to manage the data needed by the sales department to attend to the customers’ sweet tooth.\n\nWhile it may seem a bit vague at first glance, this statement aligns with the organization’s mission and the operations of the sales department. The statement will thus provide some guidance as we get further in the database design process.\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Database objectives statement\nThe database objectives are general tasks supported by the database. One way to distinguish them from the database mission is to remember that the mission statement relates to what the organization does. In contrast, the database objectives relate to the specific tasks or needs of people inside the organization (e.g., employees) or outside the organization (e.g., clients or users). Here are some examples:\n\nKeep track of students’ progress in their programs\nMaintain vehicle inventory\nManage song collections\nManage team roster\nKeep track of players’ performance\n\nHere is a list of criteria to help you write a good objective statement:\n\nIt represents a single task.\nIt is clear.\nIt does not contain unessential details.\nIt states what the task is, but does not indicate how it will be done by the database.\n\n\n2.3.2.1 Objectives for the gummybox_sales database\nIt was decided, after consultation with the GummyBox team, that their database will have the following objectives:\n\nMaintain customer information.\nKeep track of orders.\nMaintain information on gummies.\nMaintain information on gummy assortments.\nCollect product reviews."

    "section": "2.4 Subjects and attributes",
    "text": "2.4 Subjects and attributes\nNow that we have established the mission and objectives that the database will be supporting, we need to ask ourselves two questions:\n\nWhat entities (objects and events) are needed to fulfill the mission and objectives of the database? These objects and events constitute the subjects (or entities). If the mission is to support the activities of a job placement agency, your subjects would likely include jobs, job-seekers, employers, and agents. For a university, you might want to include things like students, courses, instructors, and departments.\nWhat attributes of the subjects are needed to fulfill the mission and objectives of the database? This is where you list, for each of the subjects identified with the first question, the attributes that your database requires. If one of the subjects of your database is customers, you would likely want to include their name, and possibly their email or phone number. But do you need their address? Their social insurance number? The name of their first pet? There is no universal answer, so you need to ask yourself this question for every table in your database, and answer it based on your judgement and the mission and objectives of the database.\n\nRelational databases don’t impose rules on the subjects and attributes that you can include in your database. It does, however, impose rules on how these subjects and attributes must be captured in tables (subjects) and fields (attributes).\n\n2.4.0.1 Subjects and attributes of the gummybox_sales database\nIf the objectives of your database are well formulated, they may already provide you with all the subjects you need for your database. Here are the objectives of the gummybox_sales database in which I highlighted the subjects.\n\nMaintain customer information.\nKeep track of orders.\nMaintain information on gummies.\nMaintain information on gummy assortments.\nCollect product reviews.\n\nIdentifying subjects is no more complicated than that. I have five: customer, order, gummy, gummy assortments, and reviews.\n\n\n2.4.1 Database rules\nBefore we start building our database, it is important to identify or set rules that might constrain the values that an attribute can have for a single record or the relationships that can exist between two subjects.\nAn important question to ask when conceptualizing your database is whether a single instance of a subject (e.g., a specific customer, a specific gummy, or a specific order) can have multiple values for the same attribute. Consider, for instance, the customer subject of the gummybox_sales database. The attributes we identified are the customer’s name, email and address. We may want to consider whether or not a customer should be able to have multiple addresses. We can also consider whether the database should be able to attribute multiple colours of flavours to the same gummy. These decisions are database rules that we can make specify like this:\n\nAn individual customer can have more than one address.\nAn individual gummy can have multiple colours.\nAn individual gummy can have multiple flavours.\n\nWhen conceptualizing your database, it is also important to consider rules that apply to the relationship between subjects. For example, one of the subjects in the gummybox_sales database is reviews. There are several decisions to make about reviews that may have an impact on the database design. Some relevant questions might be:\n\nDo we accept reviews from everyone or do we only accept reviews from registered customers?\nCan both individual gummies and gummy assortments be reviewed?\nCan a customer provide a review for orders or only for products?\nCan a customer review the same product multiple times?\n\nThe answer to these questions establishes the nature of the relationship between the reviews and other subjects in the database, such as gummies, gummy assortments, customers and orders. They also help ensure that all the necessary attributes have been included.\nWe can also set rules to limit the specific values that an attribute can have. These rules are often implied in the database mission and objectives. For instance, if you are building a database of Electronic music and artists, it implies that other genres will not be included in the database. In this case, you could simply not consider genre at all in the attributes of our tables, or include a genre attribute with a rule specifying that the genre must be electronic. In the gummybox_sales database, we could decide to specify the different types of flavours that a gummy can have: sweet, salty, sour, bitter and umami.\nNot all elements of your database need explicit rules, but it is important to think about them early on to prevent headaches later in the process. It is also important to remember that the rules are decisions determined by the practices and needs of the organization and the database. They are not meant to reflect the absolute reality. For example, while it is a fact that a person can have multiple addresses in real-life, we are free to decide to allow only one address per customer in our database. Similarly, if we have a country attribute in our database, we are not obligated to consider the entire set of countries that exist in the world. We can limit the set of possible countries according to our needs. These choices can also sometimes be made out of convenience when certain rules increase the complexity of a database without clear benefits.\nImportant note: The most important rules to consider, especially for this course, are whether or not records can have multiple values for the same attribute (e.g. can a customer have more than one address?) and those that define the relationship between subjects (e.g., are only registered customers allowed to post product reviews?). These rules have direct implications for your database design. On the other hand, while they can play a crucial role for data validation and quality insurance purposes, value-limiting rules (e.g. the list of values that the country attribute can have) have little to no implications for your design. It is also easy to get carried away and start defining rules for all attributes that could contain a specific set of values, so you should avoid doing that and use these rules parsimoniously. Besides, they are not mandatory for the database design that you will produce in this course.\nFinally, you should also avoid setting explicit rules when the relationship between subjects of your database is obvious. For instance, it is obvious that customers can place multiple orders and that orders can contain multiple products. Only define the rules when there are multiple suitable options for your design."

    "section": "4.2 Data types",
    "text": "4.2 Data types\nEvery field you include in a table needs to have a data type. The data type is extremely important as it determines how the relational database management system (RDBMS) will interpret, store, and potentially transform the data inserted in the tables. The data type also determines the types of operations that can be performed with the data it contains.\nUnfortunately, the data types that are available to use for your database are also determined by the type of database that you are using. In this course, we will be implementing our database designs on a PostgreSQL database, which is one type of SQL (Structured Query Language) database, others being MySQL, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server. These databases can vary in what data types they can handle, but they do share basic data types such as numbers, text, and dates.\nIn this course, we will limit the data types used to three basic kinds: character, numeric, and dates and times.\n\n4.2.1 Character data types\nCharacter data types are very flexible because they can contain any combination of letters, numbers or symbols. The most common data types are character(n) or char(n) and character varying(n) or varchar(n). The n sets the maximum number of characters that the field can contain. For example, a field with the data type varchar(5) will not be able to store strings longer than 5 characters (such as the word “banana”). The term varying indicates that the field is expected to contain strings of different length. You should use the character(n) data type only when the length of the strings you will store will not vary (ex., country codes, phone numbers, postal codes), and the character varying data type should be used when the length of the strings is expected to vary. PostgreSQL also has the text datatype which is essentially the same as character varying with no limit specification.\nMore information on the string data types can be found in the PostgreSQL documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShould you specify a maximum length for your character fields?\n\n\n\nLet’s say you are storing names of individuals in one of your database fields. You may be tempted to choose text of character varying without specifying a character limit, since you don’t know the length of the longest name that this field could ever store. However, there is in fact a limit of PostgresSQL 10,485,760 characters (which is about 1GB). Not restricting the length of the string might open the door to pranks, attacks, or errors. For example, one could enter a very long string in the field and blow up the storage requirement of your database. It is therefore recommended to set a limit to your character fields in all cases, but to make sure that the limit is large enough to accommodate all plausible values for the field.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Numeric data types\nThe numeric data types store… you guessed it: numbers! The main numeric data types available in PostgreSQL are listed in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nStorage Size\nDescription\nRange\n\n\n\n\nsmallint\n2 bytes\nsmall-range integer\n-32768 to +32767\n\n\ninteger\n4 bytes\ntypical choice for integer\n-2147483648 to +2147483647\n\n\nbigint\n8 bytes\nlarge-range integer\n-9223372036854775808 to +9223372036854775807\n\n\ndecimal\nvariable\nuser-specified precision, exact\nup to 131072 digits before the decimal point; up to 16383 digits after the decimal point\n\n\nnumeric\nvariable\nuser-specified precision, exact\nup to 131072 digits before the decimal point; up to 16383 digits after the decimal point\n\n\nreal\n4 bytes\nvariable-precision, inexact\n6 decimal digits precision\n\n\ndouble precision\n8 bytes\nvariable-precision, inexact\n15 decimal digits precision\n\n\nsmallserial\n2 bytes\nsmall autoincrementing integer\n1 to 32767\n\n\nserial\n4 bytes\nautoincrementing integer\n1 to 2147483647\n\n\nbigserial\n8 bytes\nlarge autoincrementing integer\n1 to 9223372036854775807\n\n\n\nThere are two basic types of numbers: integers (no decimals), and floating-point numbers (allow decimals).\nFor integers, the main decision you have to make is the storage size. To minimize costs and optimize performance, it is generally best to choose the smallest possible type that will be able to store all plausible values for the field.\nSerials are integers that auto-increment, which means that no values need to be inserted in this field when a new entry is created in the table. This is often used for automatically generating unique primary keys.\nFor values with decimals, I recommend using the numeric data type that allows you to fix the number of total digits and the number of decimal values. For instance, the numeric(5,2) data type indicates that the field can contain values with 5 digits and 2 decimals so the range would be -999.99 to 999.99. This is particularly useful for financial data or other cases where having more than a certain number of decimals makes no sense (e.g., 2.333$). If you do not want to fix the precision and scale of your numeric field, you can use the data type numeric without the parentheses, which will store data with any number of digits before and after th\nMore information on the numeric data types can be found in the PostgreSQL documentation.\n\n\n4.2.3 Date and time\nThe different date and time data types that you can use in MySQL are presented in the following table.\n\nsource: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-datetime.html\n\n\nName\nStorage Size\nDescription\nLow Value\nHigh Value\nResolution\n\n\n\n\ntimestamp without time zone\n8 bytes\nboth date and time (no time zone)\n4713 BC\n294276 AD\n1 microsecond\n\n\ntimestamp with time zone\n8 bytes\nboth date and time, with time zone\n4713 BC\n294276 AD\n1 microsecond\n\n\ndate\n4 bytes\ndate (no time of day)\n4713 BC\n5874897 AD\n1 day\n\n\ntime without time zone\n8 bytes\ntime of day (no date)\n00:00:00\n24:00:00\n1 microsecond\n\n\ntime with time zone\n12 bytes\ntime of day (no date), with time zone\n00:00:00+1559\n24:00:00-1559\n1 microsecond\n\n\n\nMore details on the date and time formats can be found in the PostgreSQL documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant note\n\n\n\nPostgreSQL supports a lot more data types (and structures) than those presented above, and the supported data types also vary for different RDBMS, but these systems are constantly evolving and expanding the data types they can handle. But the types presented here should be more than enough for most use cases, and in the context of this class."

While you do not need to use constraints other than the primary key and the foreign key ones for this course, it is helpful to know about constraints and what they do. Here is a list of constraints that are available in PostgreSQL.\n\nPrimary key: As you already know, the primary key must be unique and cannot be empty. The RDBMS also automatically creates an index (explained below) on this field.\nNot null: Specifies that this field must always contain a value and cannot be empty (null).\nUnique: A field with a unique constraint cannot contain duplicate values.\nForeign key: The value inserted into a foreign key must exist in the primary key field of the parent table. Null values are allowed in foreign key fields.\nCheck: The check constraint is a very flexible constraint that allows you to specify the specific values that a field can contain. For example, you could set a check constraint on the number of gummies in an order specifying that the value must be greater than 0.\nDefault: This constraint defines a default value to be inserted in the field when a new record is created, and no value is provided for that specific field."

You already know (and have applied) best practices for table and field names. That likely reduces the need for your database users to refer to the documentation all the time, but it does not eliminate the need for it. Describing your tables and fields also helps ensure they are needed and well-designed. If you cannot describe the purpose of a table, it may be that it has, in fact, no purpose.\nHere are a few simple rules to follow:\n\nClearly and concisely describe the tables and fields.\nFor tables only, your description should provide some indication of its purpose (why it is necessary).\nFocus on the content of the tables or fields rather than how they will specifically be used or accessed and by whom.\nDo not use examples in your descriptions."

    "section": "3.3 Tables and fields",
    "text": "3.3 Tables and fields\nWe already know from the short introduction to relational databases in the previous chapter that our subjects are represented as tables and their attributes as fields (columns) in those tables. However, because of the rules of relational database design, converting subjects to tables and attributes to fields is not simply a matter of changing the labels in the design.\nHere are the two most important rules to follow when creating tables:\n\nEach table represents a single subject. Gummies and their attributes are stored in one table, orders in another, customers in another, and so on. The set of fields in a table defines the subject, and it would make no sense for a subject to be defined by a gummy name, description, flavour, price as well as by a customer name, a delivery address and a phone number. When adding fields to a table, it is important to ask whether the fields are defining characteristics of the subject represented. Some associative tables (we explain what those are below) can be created for the specific purpose of capturing the relationship between two other tables or accommodate the possibility for an attribute to have multiple values for the same record. Such tables are exceptions as their function is not to represent subjects.\nEach table has at least one field that will be the primary key. The primary key is a unique identifier for each record stored in the table (the same primary key cannot appear twice in the table). The primary key is also used to reference a record from one table in another table. The field that makes the reference is called a foreign key. For instance, in the gummybox_sales database, customers will be represented in a customer table that contains a primary key named id. Records in another table (e.g., the order table) might need to indicate which customer placed the order. Rather than repeating all the customer information in the order table, each record instead simply needs to includes the id of the customer. In the order table we would then have a field named customer_id that would be a foreign key (i.e., the primary key of another table).\n\nThere are also several important principles that fields should follow:\n\nEach field should be unique in the entire database (except foreign keys). You should avoid repeating the same fields in different tables. For instance, if country is an attribute of more than one subject in your database, you should consider using a validation table (we explain what those are below) called country and include in your other tables a foreign key referencing the country table.\nEach field represents a distinct attribute of the subject. A field should not combine, for example, the birth date and the age, the height and weight and any other attributes of the subject. Each attribute has its field.\nEach field contains a single value that cannot be deconstructed into smaller ones. The name of a person is an example of a field that can be deconstructed into smaller ones (e.g., first name and last name).\nFields should not contain calculated values. For instance, we could be tempted to include the total price for an order in an order table. However, this would most likely not be optimal if the total price of an order can be calculated by multiplying the number of units included in the order by their individual price.\n\n\n3.3.1 Naming tables and fields\nHernandez (2013) proposes some guidelines for naming your tables and fields to make your database easier to understand and navigate. The table below includes all of Hernandez’s recommendations.\nCharacteristics of a good table and field names\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRule\nBad\nGood\n\n\n\n\nAccurate, unique, and meaningful to the organization\nTableA\nOrders\n\n\nRefers to a single subject (unless it is an associative table)\nFaculties/Departments\nMake two tables\n\n\nAs short as possible\nCoursesOffered\nCourses\n\n\nDo not use words like list, records, data\nCoursesList\nCourses\n\n\nDoes not use acronyms\nSRIs\nStudent_Ratings_of_Instruction\n\n\nDoes not unduly restrict the data that can be entered into the table\nFall_courses\nCourses\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Table types\nThere are three basic table types that you will encounter in your database:\n\nData tables typically represent the main subjects of your database (e.g., objects, people, events). They usually have a single primary key, and they gather data that provides information about the subject represented in the table.\nAssociative tables create associations between the subjects in your database (e.g., students-courses, products-orders, customers-orders). They have typically had multiple foreign keys that together will form the composite primary key. Some, but not all, of the main subjects of a database design can be associative tables.\nValidation tables (look-up tables) are used for data quality and validation purposes. They contain the list of possible values that a field can take. For instance, your grade for this class has a limited set of possible values (A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, F, AUD, ILL, INC, IP, P). A validation table can but does not have to be used to store these possible values to ensure that a user cannot enter the grade “G” or “Banana” in the grade field of the database. Validation tables are also useful for reducing the memory requirement of your database. You can replace large data types, such as character strings, with smaller data types, such as numbers. We will learn more about data types in the next chapter."

    "section": "3.4 Relationship types",
    "text": "3.4 Relationship types\nRelationships are critical determinants of the structure of your database. They are represented by foreign keys in some of your tables linked to other tables’ primary keys. Luckily, relationships are a relatively simple concept that is easy to implement in your database design process. There are only three basic kinds of relationships, so let’s take a quick look at them.\n\n3.4.1 One-to-one relationship\nThis relationship exists when one record in a table can only be associated with one record in another table and vice versa. A one-to-one relationship may exist, for instance, between the office space and the personnel of an organization, as long as nobody is allowed to share an office or to have two offices. These relationships are rare in reality since it often makes more sense to bring back to combine tables with one-to-one relationships in a unique table. However, there are situations where the use of one-to-one relationships can be required or appropriate, for example:\n\nSecurity: you may want to store sensitive information about an individual in a different table that only some authorized users can access.\nSemantics: even though you could include information about the office space in your employees table, you might not want to store information about your offices with your employees table. First names, last names and birth dates are characteristics of people, but buildings and room numbers are not.\n\n\n\n3.4.2 One-to-many relationship\nA one-to-many relationship exists when one record in a table can be associated with one or more records in another table. It is the most frequent type of relationship in properly designed databases. A typical example is the customers table and the orders table. A single customer record can be associated with multiple orders, but only one customer can be associated with a specific order.\n\n\n3.4.3 Many-to-many relationship\nMany-to-many relationships exist when one record in a table can be associated with multiple records in another table and vice versa. A typical example is a product that can be part of multiple orders and an order that can contain multiple products. Another example is the relationship between university courses and students. A single course can have multiple students. Inversely, a single student can be enrolled in multiple courses.\n\n3.4.3.1 Issues with many-to-many relationships\nThese relationships are widespread in the world, and they are great. However, they also raise potential issues that need to be resolved in your database design. By definition, these relationships imply that the non-duplication of the primary key rule will be violated, so that is something that your RDBMS will not allow.\n\nOne solution for that is to use a composite primary key. This means your table has two or more primary keys instead of one. In practice, that means that every combination of the two fields forming the key are not allowed to be repeated in the table.\n\nHowever, the composite key solution is often not optimal since it can create a lot of redundancy in your table, which you want to minimize as much as possible.\n\nThat is the purpose of associative tables. They are tables created with the specific purpose of linking your subjects together to prevent primary key duplication and minimize redundancy.\n\nNow the Melvil Dewey information is not repeated in the database for every course they are registered for. In fact, none of the information is repeated other than the primary and foreign keys."

Just like an index at the end of a book telling you on what page(s) you can find information about a particular concept or topic instead of having to look at each page to find those sections, the index creates a list of records where each of the different values of that field can be found and stores that list into its memory, so that those records can be retrieved much faster. So, for example, if you have 50 different gummy records in your gummy table, 12 of which are red, 25 are blue, and 13 are green, you could create an index on the gummy_color table. The index would have one record for each colour (red., blue, green), each containing a list of the gummy_id that has that colour.\nFor example, if you ask the database to retrieve blue gummies from the gummy table and you do not have an index on the colour column, it has to scan each row for “blue.” If the table has 1 million rows, then this verification has to be done 1 million times..\nNo index on the colour field of the gummy table\n\nWith an index on the colour field of the gummy table\nIf you ask the database to retrieve blue gummies from the gummy table and you have an index on the colour column, the database scans the index until it finds the colour “blue” and then fetches the rows of that are “blue.”."

Database Management Systems (DBMS) are software that supports the development, maintenance, security, and use of databases. The R in RDBMS stands for relational, and it is the kind of DBMS that we will be using to implement and manage the relational databases that we have been developing. PostgreSQL is an increasingly popular RDBMS that can also handle non-relational data structures. It does not have an interface; it is the engine that stores your data and enforces rules regarding the content of your fields and tables, who can access them, etc."

    "text": "5.3 psql and pgAdmin\npsql is a command-line interface that allows you to manage and interact with PostgreSQL using commands and SQL code. You can essentially do everything you need to do in psql, including creating databases, users, tables, importing and exporting data, etc. However, the command-line interface is not very pleasing to the eye, and while database administrators and geeky coders might insist that it is better than using a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to perform operations by clicking buttons and filling structured forms, for this course, we will use such a free and open-source GUI called pgAdmin. You will notice that every operation you perform in pgAdmin is actually translated into SQL code, and it is that code which is executed and produces the outcome. This code is often displayed in pgAdmin and that can be a useful way to learn how to learn the SQL language.\nYou can install PostgreSQL on your computer and use pgAdmin to manage local databases. However, for this course, we will use a PostgreSQL database hosted on a Microsoft Azure server. The next sections walk you through the process of installing pgAdmin, connecting to the course database, creating tables on the schema created for your team, and adding data to your tables. By the end of this process, you will have a live database that can fulfill its intended purpose."

One important thing to remember when populating your tables is that the order in which we populate the tables is important. Just like a table cannot reference another table that does not yet exist, so is a foreign key column not allowed to contain a value that does not exist in the referenced column. In practice, this means that a product that does not exist cannot be part of an order, and a customer that does not exist cannot have an address in the database, which is pretty logical, and also prevents errors in the data. So, the order for data entry is the same as for table creation: validation tables first, then data tables, then associative tables.\nThe next two sections show how to populate tables manually or by reading the data from a file.\n\n5.7.1 Manually\nYou can add data manually by viewing it and then manually filling or updating the cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.7.2 Using the import/export tool\nAdding data to cells one by one in pgAdmin can be a little time-consuming.

    "text": "6.3 Syntax\nA SQL statement typically looks like this.\n\nSELECT [TableName].[FieldName] \nFROM [DatabaseName].[TableName]\nJOIN [DatabaseName].[TableName] ON [Condition]\nWHERE [Condition]\nGROUP BY [list of fields that form groups]\nORDER BY [field(s) to use for ordering, either ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC)];\n\nIn English, the statement SELECTs some data FROM some table JOINed with some other table ON some condition, and WHERE the final joined tables meet some other condition. The aggregated values (if used) are GROUPed BY the other fields selected. Finally, the results are ORDERed BY one of the field values in ASCending or DESCending order.\nHere’s an example of an n actual SQL statement, which cacluates the average price of gummies with different consistencies, and order the resuls from highest average price to lowest.\n\nSELECT gummies.consistency, price_denominators.denominator, avg(gummies.price)\nFROM gummybox_sales.gummies\nJOIN gummybox_sales.price_denominators ON gummybox_sales.price_denominators.id = gummybox_sales.gummies.price_denominator_id\nWHERE gummies.colour = 'blue'\nGROUP BY gummies.consistency, price_denominators.denominator\nORDER BY avg(gummies.price) DESC;\n\n\n4 records\n\n\nconsistency\ndenominator\navg\n\n\n\n\nhard\nper unit\n0.50\n\n\nsoft\nper unit\n0.25\n\n\nsoft\nper gram\n0.05\n\n\nchewy\nper unit\n0.03\n\n\n\n\n\nNot all of these parts are necessary for all statements. What you need to include depends on what you are trying to achieve. However, you will rarely have any other components than these in your statements. You can write your statements on a single line or spread them on multiple lines like I do. However, you must always respect the order of the elements. Your statement will not work if you put the GROUP BY part before the WHERE part, for instance. Also, try to remember to end your statements with a semi-colon.\nFinally, keep in mind that the default setting for PostgreSQL is case sensitivity, so “banana”, “BANANA”, and “BaNaNa” are not the same. However, this does not apply to the name of tables, functions, and operators. For my examples, I capitalize the functions and operators so that they can be more easily distinguished from the other elements of the statements, but in your SQL statements, select or SELECT would be interpreted the same way and .\nIn the next section, I provide examples of the different functions and operators that you may need to use in your statements. These are far from exhaustive, but should cover 95% of the basic queries that users make when working with relational databases. Administrators of databases will typically use much more functions, but that is beyond the scope of this course."

The returned value for each column is 1 if the statement is true, and 0 if it’s false.\n\nSELECT 'banana' = 'apple'\n\n\n1 records\n\n\n?column?\n\n\n\n\nFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSELECT 10 &lt; 0\n\n\n1 records\n\n\n?column?\n\n\n\n\nFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSELECT 'b' BETWEEN 'a' AND 'c'\n\n\n1 records\n\n\n?column?\n\n\n\n\nTRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSELECT  5 &gt;= 5\n\n\n1 records\n\n\n?column?\n\n\n\n\nTRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSELECT 10 &lt; 0\n\n\n1 records\n\n\n?column?\n\n\n\n\nFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSELECT 8 in (1,4,6,8)\n\n\n1 records\n\n\n?column?\n\n\n\n\nTRUE\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we have already seen when we introduced the WHERE function, the comparison operators are usually used when checking if some condition is met.\nHere is an example in which we retrieve only the Canadian addresses from our address table.\n\nSELECT *\nFROM addresses\nWHERE addresses.country = 'Canada';\n\n\nDisplaying records 1 - 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\naddress1\naddress2\naddress3\ncity\nprovince\ncountry\npostal_code\n\n\n\n\n1\n55\nice cream crescent\nNA\nCandyland\nNS\nCanada\nH2T 1H3\n\n\n2\n66\nvanilla avenue\nNA\nCandyland\nNS\nCanada\nB3L 1A6\n\n\n3\n77\nchocolate avenue\nNA\nCandyland\nNS\nCanada\nB3K 2A7\n\n\n4\n88\nred velvet avenue\nNA\nCandyland\nNS\nCanada\nB3G 4G6\n\n\n5\n99\nmint chocolate chip lane\nNA\nCandyland\nNS\nCanada\nB4R 5F2\n\n\n6\n11\ncandycane street\nNA\nCandyland\nNS\nCanada\nB7R 4H3\n\n\n7\n22\nbrownie court\nNA\nCandyland\nNS\nCanada\nB3J 1D3\n\n\n8\n33\nsour patch drive\nNA\nCandyland\nNS\nCanada\nB3E 0I9\n\n\n9\n44\ncheesecake boulevard\nNA\nCandyland\nNS\nCanada\nB2D 5T6\n\n\n11\n100\nswedish berry cul-de-sac\nNA\nCandyland\nNS\nCanada\nB3D 9G0\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is another example in which we retrieve the name and description of gummies that are hard or stretchy.\n\nSELECT \n  gummies.name, \n  gummies.description\nFROM gummies\nWHERE gummies.consistency IN ('stretchy','hard');\n\n\n8 records\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nSalmoniakki\nSalmon flavored salted licquorice\n\n\nGarum Gummae\nA gummy take on a Roman flavor\n\n\nDog Residue\nImitates dog dropping with imitation dog dropping flavor\n\n\nKitty Litter\nEver wanted to eat the drop box?\n\n\nFrostbite\nImitates how it feels to have frostbite\n\n\nMatchsticks\nGood for eating; not to ignite\n\n\nPain\nMade with Veal; comes with an mp4 of the hand-craftsmanship of orphans making them\n\n\nTempest\nGet schwasted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.6.3 Logical (boolean) operators\nThe logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions that must all be true for the data to be returned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperators\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nAND\nReturns TRUE when all conditions are TRUE. Returns FALSE otherwise\n\n\nOR\nReturns TRUE when at least one of multiple conditions is TRUE. Returns FALSE otherwise\n\n\nNOT\nReturns TRUE when the operand is FALSE, and returns FALSE when the operand is TRUE.\n\n\n\nWe can test the boolean operators with the following statement.\n\nSELECT TRUE, \n       FALSE, \n       NOT FALSE, \n       NOT TRUE, \n       TRUE AND FALSE, \n       TRUE OR FALSE;\n\n\n1 records\n\n\nbool\nbool..2\n?column?\n?column?..4\n?column?..5\n?column?..6\n\n\n\n\nTRUE\nFALSE\nTRUE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nTRUE\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s now try this in a query and retrieve all gummies from the gummybox_sales database that are blue and AND a semi-hard consistency.\n\nSELECT gummies.id, \n       gummies.name, \n       gummies.description, \n       gummies.consistency, \n       gummies.colour\nFROM gummies \nWHERE gummies.colour = 'blue' AND gummies.consistency = 'hard';\n\n\n1 records\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\nname\ndescription\nconsistency\ncolour\n\n\n\n\n9\nFrostbite\nImitates how it feels to have frostbite\nhard\nblue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.6.4 Aggregate functions\n\n\n\nFunction\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nMIN()\nReturns the minimum value of a column.\n\n\nMAX()\nReturns the maximum value of column.\n\n\nSUM()\nReturns the sum of all values in a column.\n\n\nAVG()\nReturns the average value of a column.\n\n\nCOUNT()\nReturns the number of rows.\n\n\n\nLet’s try the aggregate operators by querying the gummybox_sales database to retrieve the number of gummies in the catalogue and their minimum, maximum, and average price.\n\nSELECT \n  COUNT(*), \n  MIN(gummies.price), \n  MAX(gummies.price), \n  AVG(gummies.price)\nFROM gummies;\n\n\n1 records\n\n\ncount\nmin\nmax\navg\n\n\n\n\n16\n0.01\n1\n0.434375\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that there are 15 entries in the gummies table, with prices ranging from 0.01$ to 1.00$ and an average price of 0.45$.\nOften times, you will want to retrieve these aggregate values for different subsets of records (e.g. to perform group comparisons). This is where the GROUP BY function comes into play. In fact, you must include a GROUP BY in your statement whenever you use an aggregate operator, unless all of your returned values are aggregates (as in the example above). Let’s write a query that returns the number of records, and the minimum, maximum, and average price for gummies of different consistency.\n\nSELECT \n  gummies.consistency, \n  COUNT(*), \n  MIN(gummies.price), \n  MAX(gummies.price), \n  AVG(gummies.price)  \nFROM gummies\nGROUP BY gummies.consistency;\n\n\n4 records\n\n\nconsistency\ncount\nmin\nmax\navg\n\n\n\n\nhard\n7\n0.01\n0.8\n0.4600000\n\n\nsoft\n6\n0.05\n0.9\n0.4166667\n\n\nstretchy\n1\n1.00\n1.0\n1.0000000\n\n\nchewy\n2\n0.03\n0.2\n0.1150000\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s important to know that PostgreSQL will not return an error message if you forget the GROUP BY part of your statement. But will instead provide an erroneous result: the first value for gummy.consistency and the aggregate value for all of the records in the table. So remember to always examine the results of your queries (no matter what they are) to see if they are consistent with your expectations, and to not simply trust that all is fine and that the query worked and did what you wanted it to do because there is no error or warning message."

This can be useful if I want to retrieve, for example, a list of all the gummies and the orders in which they were included, but keep in my list the gummies that were part of 0 orders.\n\nSELECT \n  gummies.name,\n  gummies_orders.order_id\nFROM gummies\nLEFT JOIN gummies_orders ON gummies_orders.gummy_id = gummies.id;\n\n\nDisplaying records 1 - 10\n\n\nname\norder_id\n\n\n\n\nBada Booms\n1\n\n\nVinson Drops\n2\n\n\nSalmoniakki\n3\n\n\nFroggurt\n4\n\n\nGarum Gummae\n5\n\n\nDog Residue\n7\n\n\nKitty Litter\n8\n\n\nFrostbite\n9\n\n\nMatchsticks\n1\n\n\nGummy to Go\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.7.3 RIGHT JOIN\nThe RIGHT JOIN function is the same as the LEFT JOIN function returns all records from the joined table and only records from the original table for which the matching condition is TRUE.\nNote: You rarely use right join in practice. It is usually a better idea to use a LEFT JOIN, since most RIGHT JOIN statements can be reformulated as LEFT JOIN statements.\n\nSELECT gummies_orders.order_id,\n       gummies.name\nFROM gummies_orders\nRIGHT JOIN gummies ON gummies.id = gummies_orders.gummy_id;\n\n\n\n6.7.4 UNION\nWhile the JOIN functions are used to combine fields from different tables horizontally, the UNION function vertically combines two tables. Note that this requires that the two combined tables have the same structure (same fields). In our database. Let’s use the UNION function to make a list of the names and descriptions of all the products (gummies and boxes) in our inventory.\n\nSELECT gummies.name,\n       gummies.description\nFROM gummies\nUNION\nSELECT boxes.name,\n       boxes.description\nFROM boxes;\n\n\nDisplaying records 1 - 10\n\n\nname\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nMatchsticks\nGood for eating; not to ignite\n\n\nSalty Boiz\nA collection of salty treats to dry your tongue\n\n\nSalmoniakki\nSalmon flavored salted licquorice\n\n\nVinson Drops\nSoup.

The UNION function automatically removes duplicates and returns only distinct records. If you would like to keep the duplicate rows, this can be achieved with the UNION ALL function."

    "text": "6.8 Aliases (AS)\nAliases are used to rename things within your SQL statements. You can change the name of a field or table. You can even change the data type of a field.

These are two variants of a much wider range of database types that, together, are regrouped under the NoSQL label (which can refer to “non-SQL” or “not only SQL”). These databases have grown in popularity with the rise of the web 2.0 and cloud computing, as well as the diminishing costs of data storage. Unlike relational databases that share a common language (SQL), there is no standard in the NoSQL world. However, we will not be discussing these languages in this course, but instead focus on how document-oriented databases and graph databases differ from relational databases in the way that they organize data."

    "section": "7.3 Document-oriented databases",
    "text": "7.3 Document-oriented databases\nThere exists a wide variety of document-oriented databases, each with their own particularities. We will focus here on one very popular example of document-oriented databases: MongoDB (https://www.mongodb.com/). Let’s look at the main differences between MongoDB and MySQL.\n\n7.3.1 Documents and collections\nInstead of using storing records in tables as in the relational model, MongoDB (and other document-oriented databases) do not split the data into multiple tables that are linked together through foreign keys. Instead, data is stored in documents that are grouped together in collections.\nWhile they are not conceptually equivalent, documents are to document-oriented databases what table rows are to relational databases: they are individual records that have a unique identifier. collections are equivalent to tables, they contain a set of documents, just like tables contain a set of records representend by rows.\n\n\n7.3.2 Non-structured data\nRather than the structured data format of relational databases, document-oriented databases use non-structure data formats like XML and JSON. MongoDB uses the JSON format (actually some variation of it called BSON). As you might recall from the first chapter of this course, one particularity of the non-structured data formats is that the structure of the data is included directly in each document, which means that each document in a collection can have a different structure.\n\n\n7.3.3 No (very few) relations\nAnother important feature of the JSON format is that it can include a list of values in a single field. This eliminates the need for associative tables and, consequently, the need to retrieve data with more or less complex SQL queries pulling data from multiple tables using joins. With document-oriented databases, the documents contain all the data we need, reducing the need to pull data from other collections. That said, it remains possible to link collections together, but this is not a typical use of document-oriented databases.\n\n\n7.3.4 Implications for database design\nThe differences between the relational and the document-oriented databases presented so far may seem a bit superficial or technical, but they also have important implications when it comes to designing databases. Most importantly, the documents include not only the entities’ attributes but also their relationship with other entities. This means that 1) the same data can be repeated in multiple documents and collections, and 2) there is no need for associative or validation tables. The following video shows off my exceptional whiteboard drawing skills but perhaps more importantly explains in more detail the fundamental differences between the two types of databases."

    "section": "7.4 Storing document collections in a JSON file",
    "text": "7.4 Storing document collections in a JSON file\nA JSON file is nothing more than a text file that contains text that follows the JSON syntax. So we can create them with any text editor (e.g. notepad). A JSON file must always begin with and end with a curly bracket {}.\n\n7.4.1 Key-value pairs\nIn JSON, everything is a key-value pair except for objects and arrays for which the key is optional.\nThe key is always between double quotes, and so are values that are strings. Here’s an example of a key-value pair.\n\"name\":\"Barry Bonds\"\nSo a JSON file with only that one key-value pair would look like this:\n{ \"name\":\"Barry Bonds\" }\n\n\n7.4.2 Types of values\nIn JSON, values must be one of the following data types:\n\nString \"name\":\"bada booms\"\nNumber \"number_of_children\":10\nBoolean \"sale\":true\nNULL \"middlename\":null\nObject {\"name\":\"John\", \"age\":30, \"city\":\"New York\"}\nArray [\"John\", \"Anna\", \"Peter\"]\n\n\n\n7.4.3 Creating a document (JSON object)\nHere’s an example of a fictional course written as a JSON, which is an example of a document that we could eventually want to store in a collection.\n{\n  \"code\": \"INFO6540\",\n   \"semester\": \"Winter\",\n   \"year\": 2023,\n   \"description\": \"This is the course description\",\n   \"brightspace_active\": true,\n   \"students\": [\n      {\"id\": \"B00123456\", \"name\": \"Wayne Gretzky\"},\n      {\"id\": \"B00654321\", \"name\": \"Mario Lemieux\"}],\n   \"supplementary_files_url\": null\n}\nAnd here is another course.\n{\n  \"code\": \"INFO6270\",\n  \"semester\": \"Fall\",\n  \"year\": 2022,\n  \"name\": \"Singing for dummies\",\n  \"description\": \"This the course description for INFO6270\",\n  \"brightspace_active\": false,\n  \"room\":\"ROWE1234\",\n  \"students\": [\n                {\"id\": \"B00123457\", \"name\": \"Justin Bieber\"},\n                {\"id\": \"B00865321\", \"name\": \"Lady Gaga\"}\n              ],\n  \"supplementary_files_url\": \"www.info6270_sup.ca\"\n}\nwe can see that the document contains strings (code, semester, description), numbers (year), booleans (brightspace_active), and an array (students) that contain objects.\n\n\n7.4.4 Creating a collection (JSON array)\nA collection is essentially a group of objects grouped together in an array. For example, if we wanted to store all our courses together into a collection of courses, we could do it in a single JSON file that contains an array called “courses”, like this:\n{\n  \"courses\": [\n    {\n      \"code\": \"INFO6540\",\n      \"semester\": \"Winter\",\n      \"year\": 2023,\n      \"description\": \"This is the course description\",\n      \"brightspace_active\": true,\n      \"students\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"B00123456\",\n          \"name\": \"Wayne Gretzky\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"B00654321\",\n          \"name\": \"Mario Lemieux\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"supplementary_files_url\": null\n    },\n{\n      \"code\": \"INFO6270\",\n      \"semester\": \"Fall\",\n      \"year\": 2022,\n      \"name\": \"Singing for dummies\",\n      \"description\": \"This the course description for INFO6270\",\n      \"brightspace_active\": false,\n      \"room\":\"ROWE1234\",\n      \"students\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"B00123457\",\n          \"name\": \"Justin Bieber\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"B00865321\",\n          \"name\": \"Lady Gaga\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"supplementary_files_url\": \"www.info6270_sup.ca\"\n    }    \n  ]\n}\n\n\n7.4.5 Multiple collections in a single JSON file\nWe can include multiple collections in a single JSON file simply a second array. Let’s add a student collection to the our JSON file.\n{\n  \"courses\": [\n    {\n      \"code\": \"INFO6540\",\n      \"semester\": \"Winter\",\n      \"year\": 2023,\n      \"description\": \"This is the course description\",\n      \"brightspace_active\": true,\n      \"students\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"B00123456\",\n          \"name\": \"Wayne Gretzky\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"B00654321\",\n          \"name\": \"Mario Lemieux\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"supplementary_files_url\": null\n    },\n{\n      \"code\": \"INFO6270\",\n      \"semester\": \"Fall\",\n      \"year\": 2022,\n      \"name\": \"Singing for dummies\",\n      \"description\": \"This the course description for INFO6270\",\n      \"brightspace_active\": false,\n      \"room\":\"ROWE1234\",\n      \"students\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"B00123457\",\n          \"name\": \"Justin Bieber\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"B00865321\",\n          \"name\": \"Lady Gaga\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"supplementary_files_url\": \"www.info6270_sup.ca\"\n    }    \n  ],\n  \"students\":[\n    {\n      \"id\":\"B00865321\",\n      \"name\":\"Lady Gaga\",\n      \"courses\":[\n        {\n          \"code\":\"INFO6270\",\n          \"completed\":true,\n          \"grade\":\"B-\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\":\"B00123457\",\n      \"name\":\"Justin Bieber\",\n      \"courses\":[\n        {\n          \"code\":\"INFO6270\",\n          \"completed\":true,\n          \"grade\":\"C+\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\":\"B00123456\",\n      \"name\":\"Wayne Gretzky\",\n      \"courses\":[\n        {\n          \"code\":\"INFO6540\",\n          \"completed\":false,\n          \"grade\":null\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\":\"B00654321\",\n      \"name\":\"Mario Lemieux\",\n      \"courses\":[\n        {\n          \"code\":\"INFO6540\",\n          \"completed\":false,\n          \"grade\":null\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}"

    "text": "8.2 Graph databases\nIn graph databases, the data is stored as collections of edges, nodes to which we assign properties, and the priority is on the relationship between the different data elements. They are used to visualize data in graphs (networks)and are thus particularly useful to explore how people, processes, and objects are interrelated.\nOntologies, which we will introduce in the next chapter, are essentially a form of graph with a semantic layer and a bunch of rules that formalize the types of entities and relationships that exist within a knowledge domain. For now, let us simply look at the most basic components that are found in every single graph: nodes, edges,and attributes.\n\n8.2.1 Nodes\nNodes are simply entities of some kind, such as people, products, processes, event, concepts, etc. Depending on the purpose of the graph and the available data, nodes can be practically anything.\nThis is a node :\n\nA graph that represents a single kind of entity (e.g., students) is called unimodal, and one representing different kinds of things (e.g., students and courses) is called multimodal.\n\n\n8.2.2 Edges\nAnd edge is a relationship that exists between two nodes. Like nodes, depending on the purpose of the graph, the edges can represent anything. An edge must have two nodes.\nThis is an edge:\n\nNote that an edge can relate a node to itself (that’s called a self-loop):\n\nThere are two types of edges: directed and undirected . The directed edge indicates that the relationship has a direction (e.g., I like ice cream, but ice cream doesn’t like me back):\n\nThe undirected edge represent associations and co-occurences. For instance, we could form an undirected edge between two students (node) that are taking the same course:\n\nNote: While the direction of the edges is an attribute of nodes, the undirected and directed attributes are usually not used in combination in the same graph, so we will most often refer to an undirected or directed graphs.\n\n\n8.2.3 Attributes\nNodes and edges can have attributes that can be used to manipulate their appearance in the graph (e.g., size, shape, color, label). Here is a network where the nodes have label:"

    "text": "8.3 Creating a network dataset\n\n8.3.1 Edges list\nThe most basic form of network can be constructed from a simple table of edges with two columns.\nHere is an example:\n\n\n\nFrom\nTo\n\n\n\n\nStudent A\nStudent B\n\n\nStudent A\nStudent C\n\n\nStudent B\nStudent C\n\n\nStudent C\nStudent D\n\n\n\nNote: There is no standard for the names of your columns. Some network analysis or visualization tools will use from and to, some will use source and target, and some others my not require headers at all. Please also note that if you are building an undirected graph, you only need to include the relationship between A and B once. In other words, once the relationship between Student A and Student B has been entered, there is no need to add another row to indicate that Student B is also related to Student A.\n\n8.3.1.1 Adding attributes\nThe most common attribute to provide for your edges are a weight representing the strength of the relationship between two nodes. For instance if you have a directed network representing email sent from people to other people, then the weight could be the number of emails sent by the person in the from column to the person in the To column. Like this:\n\n\n\nFrom\nTo\nWeight\n\n\n\n\nStudent A\nStudent B\n15\n\n\nStudent A\nStudent C\n4\n\n\nStudent B\nStudent C\n542\n\n\nStudent C\nStudent D\n5\n\n\n\nWe can also indicate whether the relationship is directed or undirected, and also add a label for the edge. Like this\n\n\n\nFrom\nTo\nWeight\nType\nLabel\n\n\n\n\nStudent A\nStudent B\n15\ndirected\nemailed\n\n\nStudent A\nStudent C\n4\ndirected\nemailed\n\n\nStudent B\nStudent C\n542\ndirected\nemailed\n\n\nStudent C\nStudent D\n5\ndirected\nemailed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.2 Nodes list\nIn the table above the students are nodes and the from and to columns contain the student IDs. The nodes lists is simply a list of all the students in the networks, along with any number of attributes. The only mandatory column in a nodes list is usually the ID column, and the most common attribute is a label which is required to display a label for the node when visualizing the graph. Categorical attributes are typically used to color the nodes, and numerical attributes are typically used for node size. Here’s an example:\n\n\n\nid\nlabel\nprogram\nemails_written\n\n\n\n\nStudent A\nStudent A\nMI\n19\n\n\nStudent B\nStudent B\nMBA\n542\n\n\nStudent C\nStudent C\nMREM\n5\n\n\nStudent D\nStudent D\nMI\n0"

It has a tiny bit of a learning curve, but it has the advantage of being free and able to support various kinds of network related tasks.\nThe edges list for Gephi should include the a source column and a target columns (equivalent to From and To in the example above).\nThe nodes list for Gephi is not mandatory (nodes will be created automatically if you import an edge list). If you do import your own nodes list, the advantage is that you can include as many attributes as you’d like, and use them to filter, size or color your nodes if you wish. The only mandatory column is id (this is what the Source and Target columns contain)."

They can be represented as nodes or as attributes of nodes in a graph.\nIndividuals: These are instances of objects or concepts that belong to a class. They are represented as nodes in a graph.\nRelationships: These are the ways in which individuals and classes can be related to one another. They are represented as edges in the graph.\nAttributes: Attributes are characteristics of individuals, classes, or relationships (e.g. price of an individual of the class product, or date of birth of an individual of the class person).\nTriples: A triple is a representation of ontological components that take the following form:\n\n\nSUBJECT PREDICATE OBJECT\n\nFor instance:\n\nIn a film ontology: Sylvester Stallone (subject) wrote (predicate) Rocky (object)\nIn a Dalhousie ontology: Philippe Mongeon (subject) teaches (predicate) Data Management (object)\nIn a hockey ontology: Brad Marchand (subject) plays for (predicate) Boston Bruins (subject)\n\nBasically, the subject and the objects are two nodes in the network, and the predicate is the label of the edge that unites the nodes in the network."

    "text": "9.4 Building a simple ontology\nLet us now go through a series of five simple steps to build a very simple ontology. This is the exact process that I suggest that you follow for the final assignment. Please use this template for this purpose and for your final assignment. It comes pre-loaded with the example presented below.\nImportant note: in order to simplify the process we will not use attributes in this example, nor in the final assignment.\nThe five steps are:\n\nDefining classes\nDefining individuals\nAssigning individuals to classes\nDefining characteristics\nWriting triples\n\nHere’s an example of how to follow these steps to fill the provided template to build a basic pizza ontology.\n\nWhat kind of things do exists in the domain you want to represent?\nThese are your classes. Make a list and insert them in the classes sheet of the template.\n\n\n\nClass_id\nClass\n\n\n\n\n1\nPizza\n\n\n2\nBase\n\n\n3\nSauce\n\n\n4\nCheese\n\n\n5\nTopping\n\n\n\nWhat individuals (instances of classes) do you want to include in my ontology?\nThese will be the nodes in your network. Write in the template the name of each individual in the individuals sheet under the name column. \n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual_id\nName\n\n\n\n\n1\nHawaiian\n\n\n2\nCanadian\n\n\n3\nChicken Alfredo\n\n\n4\nAlfredo\n\n\n5\nChicago style\n\n\n6\nMozzarella\n\n\n7\nPineapple\n\n\n\nTo which class do each individual belong?\nTo what class does each of my individuals belong. Your individuals should belong to only one class. You should also have at least one individual for each class, otherwise that class is irrelevant for your ontology. Write the class to which each individual belongs in the class column of he individuals sheet.\n\n\n\nIndividual_id\nName\nClass_id\n\n\n\n\n1\nHawaiian\n1\n\n\n2\nCanadian\n1\n\n\n3\nChicken Alfredo\n1\n\n\n4\nTomato\n3\n\n\n5\nChicago style\n2\n\n\n6\nMozzarella\n4\n\n\n7\nPineapple\n5\n\n\n\nWhat type of relationships between individuals exist in my ontology?\nIn the relationships sheet, make a list of the different types of relationships that exist between your individuals. Your relationship should be verbs (e.g., acts_in, is_author_of, has_flavor, bought). For each of your relationship, consider whether it has a inverse relationship (e.g., has_actor, has_author is_flavor_of, was_bought_by) and if that is the case, indicate it in the inverse_relationship column. Here is an example:\n\n\n\nRelationship_id\nRelationship\nInverse_relationship\n\n\n\n\n1\nhas_topping\nis_topping_of\n\n\n2\nhas_base\nis_base_of\n\n\n3\nhas_sauce\nis_sauce_of\n\n\n4\nhas_cheese\nis_cheese_of\n\n\n\nImportant note: For your individual assignment you should have at least 3 relationships, excluding the inverse ones and you should not use the is_a relationships (these are used to link objects with their class, but for our purpose, we included the class as an attribute in the individuals sheet).\nWhat relationships exist between individuals exist in my ontology?\nThis is where you write your triples in the triples sheet of the template. Make sure that each individual has a relationship with at least one other. In sheet you want to write the ID of each component, but it may be less confusing to start with the actual names of the individuals and relationship, like this:\n\n\n\nSubject_id\nRelationship_id\nObject_id\n\n\n\n\nCanadian\nhas_cheese\nMozzarella\n\n\nCanadian\nhas_base\nChicago style\n\n\nHawaiian\nhas_topping\nPineapple\n\n\nChicken Alfredo Pizza\nhas_sauce\nAlfredo\n\n\n\nAnd then you can replace the values with their respective IDs.\n\n\n\nSubject_id\nRelationship_id\nObject_id\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n6\n\n\n2\n2\n5\n\n\n1\n1\n7\n\n\n3\n3\n4\n\n\n\nAs mentioned above, you could normally represent the relationship between an individual and its class can be represented in triples using the is_a relationship (e.g., Philippe is_a Professor). But for this assignment we will not use the is_a relationship, since the link between each individual and its class is already declared in the individuals table.\n\n\n9.4.1 Visualizing our graph\nI created a very primitive web application that can read data from the ontology template provided. Here is our graph:"

Please make sure you download DBeaver community (that’s the free version) from the dbeaver.io website, and not one of the paid versions (e.g. DBeaver Lite) from the dbeaver.com website. Then install DBeaver and keep all the default settings throughout the installation.\n\n\n5.3.2 DBeaver demo\nFor now I decided to not write instructions on how to use DBeaver with text and screenshots, but instead to record a live demo. You will find that recording in the content tab on Brightspace. The video walks you through the process of:\n\nconnecting to the database;\nfinding your schema (your database);\ncreating tables, columns, and relationships between tables (foreign keys);\nentering data in your tables;\nvisualizing your entity relationship diagram in DBeaver."
