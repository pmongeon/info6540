# Plan

-   Rules for tables

-   Rules for fields

-   Types of relationships

-   Types of tables

-   Entity-relationship diagram

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(kableExtra)
```

```{=html}
<style>
    .reveal section img { 
        background:none; 
        border:none; 
        box-shadow:none; 
</style>
```
# Rules for tables

-   Each table represents a single subject

-   Each table as a primary key

## What's wrong with this table

::: {style="text-align:left"}
**Table name:** musician
:::

| first_name | last_name | email             | name of band | number of albums | Role    |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Jon        | Bongiovi  | jbj\@jbj.net      | Bon Jovi     | 12               | Singer  |
| Lars       | Ulrich    | lu\@metallica.edu | Metallica    | 15               | Drummer |

# Rules for fields

-   Each field should be unique in the entire database (except foreign keys)

-   Each field represents a distinct attribute of the subject

-   Each field contains a single value that can't be deconstructed

-   Fields should not contain calculated value

## What's wrong with this table?

::: {style="text-align:left"}
**Table name:** course
:::

| id  | course_code  | number_of_students | instructor        |
|-----|--------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| 1   | INFO6660_W22 | 25                 | Bertrum MacDonald |

# Types of relationships

-   One-to-One

    -   A person can have one social insurance number, and a social insurance number can only belong to one person.

-   One-to-Many

    -   A player can only be in one team, but a team can have many players.

-   Many-to-Many

    -   A person can have many addresses, and many people can live at the same address

# **Types of tables**

-   Data table (represent your subjects)

-   Associative table (used to link fields with many-to-many relationships)

-   Look-up tables (stores the set of possible values for a field)

# Entity-relationship diagrams

## Tips

-   Start with your data tables.

-   Follow your database rules. They tell you what type of relationship exists between fields.

-   Keep it simple.

-   Remember that there is no rule that says you have to use look-up tables whenever you could.

-   Remember that you can adjust your database objectives if necessary.
